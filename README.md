# Title of the Project
EcoScan : Track down Your Energy Usage for a better environment for everyone!

# Summary of the Project
EcoScan is designed to help users to create a better environment for everyone. the app is built to make users aware of how much energy their daily appliances is using and how they can affect the user's personal life and other people's life. the app can receive inputs of images of the user's daily appliances and scan for its energy usage. the app will then display a list of outputs regarding the scanned / uploaded item. the output consists of Name of the appliance, Energy Usage, Disposal Effect, Production Effect, Consumption Effect, the Image of the appliances, the location where the appliances might be found in the user's home, resource, result, and recomendations. the app has a simple design in order to make sure that the user knows they output that theyre getting from the app.

EcoScan also provides a feature where user can look for items by picking on a form. the form consists of location of the appliances, the name for the device and its detailed type. whenever the users submit a form, EcoScan will search through its database to find the corresponding result for that appliances. making it flexible for user whenever they can't use their cameras or photos.

Overall, EcoScan helps users to be aware on their daily appliances energy usage and how can they make a better environment, not only for themselves, but also all of us!

# Steps to Replicate the Project

1. Machine Learning
- Gather the required dataset
Collect the dataset from open and public dataset provider (kaggle, roboflow, etc) or scrape images if needed. In this case, we are scrape images of household appliances from Google using Chrome Extension: Download All Images.
After that, we cleaning and resizing the dataset. Only images meet the specified criteria are used by us. After that we split the balanced data per class with a training and validation ratio of 70:30

- Build the model
Before building the model we do image augmentation.To build a model start with install all the libraries required for image classification models, we use Tensorflow and transfer learning model: DenseNet121, of which you can see the architecture at the following link: https://iq.opengenus.org/architecture-of-densenet121/. Then add training again in addition with GlobalAveragePooling2D(), Dense(11, activation='softmax')
Train the model using local Jupyter Notebook.

- Plot the loss and accuracy of training and validation into metrics. 
We can see if this model is either overfitting, underfitting, or suit the dataset well. In this case, the DenseNet121 suits our dataset well with accuracy >96%.

- Save the model
We save the model in .h5 format using command model.save("your_model_name.h5").

- Make predictions
Install all libraries required.
Define the label of our classes (we have 11 classes: Air Conditioner, Hair Dryer, Iron, Laptop, Oven, Rice Cooker, Refrigerator, Television, Vacuum Cleaner, Washing Machine, and Lamp).
Load the image for testing.
Resize and converted the image into array form.
Load the model that we saved before (in step 5).
Make predictions (in our case,the predictions for all classes have a confidence value > 90%).

- Configure and deploy the model

2. Cloud Computing
- Build the Flask Environment on your local computer and editor (in this case we are using Visual Studio Code)
- Install all the libraries required for the application (Both ML and CC)
- Create a Cloud SQL Instance so we can use MySQL and store our data in the database
- Head over to PhpMyAdmin to create the database and all the tables required. in this case we have 6 tables that are connected to each other using Primary key and Foreign Key
- Code the API based on the Machine Learning's Model's Output using route and the methods for it
- Test if the API is correct and give out the correct results by using Postman
- Create a VM instance in GCP using Compute Engine with your prefered requirements.
- Setup Firewalls and all the dependencies you need like location, storage, etc.
- Once the VM is ready, connect using SSH
- Once you in the SSH install Python and all the required libraries in it
- Deploy the API by running the command "python3 your_file_name.py"
- Test the API again using Postman with the External IP of the VM instance
- If the API has been deployed and gives out correct results then its time to hand it to the Mobile Development
- Monitor the API incase there are any errors or bugs

3. Mobile Development
- Design Wireframe
- Design Mockup
- Slicing/Implement our Mockup to UI
- Use Navigation Component for flow of Application
- Implement clean architecture for consuming/Integrating to API with Retrofit2
- Build APK
